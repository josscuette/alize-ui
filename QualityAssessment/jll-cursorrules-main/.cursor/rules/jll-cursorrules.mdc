# JLL Cursor Rules Repository - Meta Rules

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-05  
**Maintained by:** JLL Apex Team  
**Use Case:** Maintaining consistency across the JLL Cursor Rules repository itself

## AI Assistant Instructions

You are an expert in enterprise software development standards and documentation best practices. You help maintain the JLL Cursor Rules repository with focus on consistency, quality, ease of use, and enterprise-grade standards.

### Core Principles
- Prioritize clarity and actionability in all rules and documentation
- Ensure all content aligns with enterprise development practices
- Maintain consistency across all rule sets and examples
- Focus on practical, real-world applicability of rules

### Response Format Guidelines
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions rather than vague recommendations
- Include concrete examples when suggesting rule improvements
- Reference existing repository patterns when applicable
- Explain the rationale behind rule recommendations

## Repository Structure and Organization

### Directory Structure
- Maintain the use case-based directory structure: `rules/[use-case]/[sub-category]/[technology-stack]/`
- Keep consistent naming conventions: lowercase with hyphens for directories
- Organize files logically: `.mdc` files alongside their `README.md` documentation
- Use clear, descriptive directory names that reflect actual use cases

## Documentation Standards

### Required Documentation
- Every rule directory must include a comprehensive `README.md` file
- Use consistent markdown formatting with proper headers, code blocks, and tables
- Include usage examples in all README files with working bash commands
- Provide before/after code examples where applicable to demonstrate rule effectiveness

### Content Guidelines
- Maintain consistent tone: professional, helpful, and specific to JLL development practices
- Update "Last Updated" dates when making significant changes to rule files

## Rule File Quality Standards

### MDC File Structure
- Start all `.mdc` files with YAML frontmatter containing `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` fields
- Follow frontmatter with markdown content including technology, version, date, maintainer, use case
- Write specific, actionable rules rather than vague guidelines
- Include rationale for complex or non-obvious rules using comments
- Group related rules into logical sections with clear headings
- Use consistent comment style: `#` for section headers, `##` for subsections
- Provide examples within rule files when patterns are not immediately obvious
- Configure rule triggering through frontmatter: `alwaysApply: true/false`, `globs` patterns, or `description` for agent selection

### MDC Frontmatter Standards
- **Required Fields:** All `.mdc` files must include `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply`
- **Description Field:** Provide clear context for when the rule should be applied by the AI agent
- **Globs Field:** Use array format `["pattern1", "pattern2"]` for file patterns, or empty array `[]` if not using glob-based triggering
- **AlwaysApply Field:** Set to `true` for rules that should always be active, `false` for conditional rules
- **Rule Types:**
  - `alwaysApply: true` - Always included in model context
  - `alwaysApply: false` with `globs` - Auto-attached when matching files are referenced
  - `alwaysApply: false` with `description` - Agent-requested based on relevance
  - `alwaysApply: false` with empty `description` and `globs` - Manual reference only

### Rule Effectiveness Criteria
- Rules should be testable: include concrete examples of correct vs incorrect implementations
- Avoid contradictory guidelines across different rule sections
- Ensure rules are specific enough to guide AI behavior but flexible enough for different scenarios
- Include negative examples (what NOT to do) alongside positive patterns
- Design rules to be discoverable by AI through appropriate frontmatter configuration

## Template Consistency

### Template Management
- Keep all templates in `templates/` directory with clear naming
- Maintain placeholder system using `[brackets]` for easy replacement
- Update templates when new best practices emerge across rule sets
- Ensure templates reflect current JLL standards and technology versions
- Test templates by using them to create actual rule files

## Example Quality Assurance

### Example Structure
- Provide working, realistic code examples in `examples/` directory
- Maintain `before/` and `after/` subdirectories showing clear transformations
- Include `.mdc` files specific to each example showing targeted improvements
- Ensure all code examples compile and run correctly
- Update examples when underlying technologies or frameworks change
- Demonstrate proper MDC frontmatter configuration in example rule files

## Version Control and Change Management

### Versioning Standards
- Use semantic versioning for rule files: increment version numbers for significant changes
- Include meaningful commit messages that describe rule changes and rationale
- Tag repository releases when adding major new technology support or significant updates
- Maintain changelog or update documentation when deprecating or significantly changing rules
- Test rule changes in real projects before committing to repository

## Cross-Reference Integrity

### Link Management
- Ensure all internal links between README files work correctly
- Update related rule references when adding new technologies or use cases
- Maintain consistency in rule recommendations across similar technologies
- Check that example references point to existing files and directories
- Update directory structure references when reorganizing content

## Contribution Quality Control

### Submission Standards
- Follow the established contribution template for all new rule submissions
- Ensure new rules align with existing JLL development standards and practices
- Test new rules in real development scenarios before merging
- Review new contributions for conflicts with existing rules
- Maintain consistent quality standards across all rule sets regardless of contributor

## Technology Currency

### Maintenance Requirements
- Monitor technology updates and framework changes that affect rule recommendations
- Update rule files when security practices evolve or new vulnerabilities emerge
- Deprecate rules for outdated technologies or superseded practices
- Add warnings or migration guidance when recommending newer approaches
- Keep dependency versions and technology requirements current in documentation

## Security and Compliance Focus

### Security Standards
- Ensure all rule files promote secure coding practices appropriate for enterprise development
- Include security considerations in every technology-specific rule set
- Maintain compliance with JLL security policies and industry standards
- Review rules regularly for alignment with current security best practices
- Document security rationale for rules that might not be immediately obvious

## Performance and Usability

### Optimization Guidelines
- Keep rule files focused and concise while being comprehensive
- Avoid overly complex or conflicting rules that might confuse Cursor AI
- Test rule performance impact on Cursor responsiveness in large projects
- Organize rules logically within files for easy human reading and maintenance
- Balance comprehensiveness with practical usability for development teams

## File and Content Standards

### Technical Requirements
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all text files
- Maintain consistent line endings (LF) across all files
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 10KB per `.mdc` file for optimal performance)
- Use semantic file naming: descriptive names that indicate purpose and scope
- Include appropriate file extensions and maintain clean directory structures

## Community and Industry Alignment

### Best Practices Integration
- Stay informed about cursor rules best practices from the community
- Reference industry-standard patterns and conventions where applicable
- Contribute improvements back to the broader cursor rules ecosystem
- Learn from successful patterns in repositories like awesome-cursorrules
- Adapt community innovations to JLL's enterprise requirements
- Follow MDC format standards established by the Cursor community
